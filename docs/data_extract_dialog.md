## Data Extraction

Data Extraction feature allows exporting of data from a select set of Fields and Record Types from a fixed-width data file into a new file.

The field data can be optionally prefixed and suffixed by text labels, separator text and new lines to effectively build a quick, human-readable report from the fixed-width file.

The data extraction feature can be especially useful with mixed-record fixed-width data files wherein column mode selection of field data is not possible.
